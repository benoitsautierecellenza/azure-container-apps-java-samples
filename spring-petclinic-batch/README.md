# Launch your Spring Batch Jobs in Azure Container App Jobs

## Overview
This is the companion repository for the [Azure Container Apps Spring Batch quickstart](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/java-springbatch-get-started). This repository contains Java samples that demonstrate how to build your own images and deploy to Azure Container App Jobs.

## Build your own images and deploy to Azure Container App Jobs

In [Azure Container Apps Spring Batch quickstart](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/java-springbatch-get-started), you're using our [built images](https://github.com/orgs/Azure-Samples/packages?q=spring-petclinic&tab=packages&q=spring-petclinic-batch) for the Spring Batch Job.

1. Fork your own copy of [Azure-samples/azure-container-apps-java-samples](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-container-apps-java-samples) by clicking the Fork button in the upper right corner of the repository.

2. Go to spring-petclinic-batch directory in your forked repository, modify the code and push to your forked repository.

3. Go to your forked `azure-container-apps-java-samples` repository, navigate to the `GitHub Actions` tab, choose `Publish SpringBatch PetClinic images` workflow, and click `Run workflow`. The image tag version is optional for your customized images, you can leave it empty to use the default value `latest`.

5. There should be one package. Click on the package name to see the details of the package. Update or create your container apps with these images as how [Azure Container Apps Spring Batch quickstart](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/java-springbatch-get-started) does.
